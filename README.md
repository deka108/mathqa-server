# MathQA Server Development

## Loading data
1. The data used for this project is stored inside db.json
2. Load it using `python manage.py loaddata db.json` command

## Running the Server
1. cd to the main MathQA server directory
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source activate env`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Load the data
5. Run the server `python manage.py runserver at 0.0.0.0:8000`

## Running Latex Viewer
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install jspm and live-server via npm
3. cd to latex_viewer directory
4. Run `jspm install`
5. Fix dependencies for Angular-Filter:
    1. Go inside jspm_packages/npm/angular-filter
    2. Create index.js then copy and paste the following script:
    ```
    require('./dist/angular-filter');
    module.exports = 'angular-filter';
    ```
6. Run `live-server .` which starts a node.js server at http://localhost:8080
7. Navigate to different html views by clicking the link inside the side-navigator or by manually appending the html layout to the hostname:
http://localhost:8080/[page].html

## Models and APIs
1. The model and the APIs are developed under apiv2 module
2. The REST APIs are available under the `apiv2/urls.py`
3. APIs for accessing models in general:
    - `/apiv2/[object]s/`: retrieve all objects from the database
    - `/apiv2/[object]s/[object_id]`: retrieve 1 object from the database based on object id
    - Advanced filtering methods are also available with the help of filters. To views the available filter, please look inside `apiv2/views.py` module. Example of API filter:
    `/apiv2/questions/?concept=1`: retrieve all questions that have the same concept id=1
4. APIs for Searching: the API for search services are available inside `apiv2/views.py` as Python methods prefixed with search_[search_type]
    - search_database(): `/apiv2/search/?type=d&query=[query]` for database search
    - search_text(): `/apiv2/search/?type=t&query=[query]` for full-text search (using Haystack)
    - search_formula(): `/apiv2/search/?type=f&query=[query]` for formula search

## Mathematical Document Retrieval
The three types of mathematical document retrieval are supported, which include `search_database`, `search_text` and `search_formula` methods.  These implementation can be found under `apiv2/views.py`

1. `search_database` method performs raw text retrieval using Django icontains queryset
2. `search_text` method performs full-text search using Django Haystack. Both the data and query is first preprocessed using `apiv2/search/utils/text_util.py` module
3. The formula search implementation is available under apiv2/search/fsearch directory. This module composed of 4 main modules:
    - `formula_features_extractor.py`: extracts formula terms from raw latex syntax (excluding the delimiters such as $$ latex $$, $ latex $, \[ latex \] or \( latex \). If these delimiters exist, extract it first using `formula_extractor` module
    - `formula_extractor.py`: extracts raw latex string from latex delimiters
    - `formula_indexer.py`: creates inverted formula table (i.e. formula index table) based on existing formula data in the database.
    - `formula_retriever.py`: performs formula query matching with the formula index table, ranks the results and serve the search results in the form of (formula, question) pair (please refer to the search_formula method under `views.py` and  `serializers.py` module for a better understanding).
