518,Trapezium Rule,F,36,"The trapezium rule is a numerical method for estimating integrals. It is most useful when there is no analytical answer to an integral, and only a number is needed. It works by approximating the area under the curve by a series of trapezia, then evaluating the areas and adding them up.
;The formula for the integral rule is $$l = \frac{h}{2}(y_{0} + 2(y_{1} + y_{2} + ... + y_{n-1}) + y_{n})$$ where $$h$$ is the step size or the increment by which the values of $$x$$."

;The estimate starts at $$x_{1}$$,for a root of $$f(x) = 0$$. 
;A tangent is then draw to the curve $$y = f(x)$$ at the point $$(x_{1}, f(x_{1}))$$. The point at which the tangent cuts the x-axis then gives the next approximation for the root, and the process is repeated.
;The new estimate for the root is found using the iteration: $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}$$"
520,Linear Interpolation,F,1,"Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials.
;To estimate the value of the root we join the y-values with a straight line and find where this crosses the x-axis.

521,Cover Up Rule,C,36,"The ""cover-up method"" is a quick way of working out partial fractions, but it is important to realize that this only works when there are linear factors in the denominator.
;For instance to put   $$\frac{5(x + 2)}{ (x + 1)(x + 6)}$$ into partial fractions using the cover up method:
;cover up the $$x + 6$$ with your hand and substitute -6 into what's left, giving $$5(-6 + 2)/(-6+1) = -20/-5 = 4$$. This tells you that one of the partial fractions is $$4/(x + 6)$$. Now cover up $$(x + 1)$$ and substitute -1 into what's left to discover that the other partial fraction is $$1/(x + 1)$$."
522,Partial Fractions,C,36,"It is possible to split many fractions into the sum or difference of two or more fractions.
;For instance:
;$$\frac{1}{(x+1)} + \frac{4}{(x + 6)} = \frac{5(x + 2)}{(x + 1)(x + 6)}$$
