Integration by Substitution,24,Given a function $$f(x)$$ : $$\int f(x)dx = F(x)$$. Suppose $$x$$ is also a function of $$u$$: $$\int g'(u)f(g(u))du = F(g(u))$$. SInce $$F(x) = F(g(u))$$: $$\int f(x)dx = \int g'(u)f(g(u))du = \int \frac{du}{dx}f(g(u))du$$. Hence $$\int f(x)dx = \int f(g(u))\frac{dx}{du}du$$ where $$x = g(u)$$ and $$\frac{dx}{du} = g'(u)$$ and $$x = g(u)$$ is known as Substitution.

Cover Up Rule,36,"The ""cover-up method"" is a quick way of working out partial fractions, but it is important to realize that this only works when there are linear factors in the denominator.

;cover up the $$x + 6$$ with your hand and substitute -6 into what's left, giving $$5(-6 + 2)/(-6+1) = -20/-5 = 4$$. This tells you that one of the partial fractions is $$4/(x + 6)$$.

Percentage_decimal_fraction,119,"Per cent means 'hundredth' or 'out of 100'. Expressing a value in percentage is another way of writing a decimal or fraction with a denominator 100. The symbol % is used for percent. ; To convert a decimal to percentage, multiply the decimal by 100 by moving the decimal point 2 places to the right. Do the opposite to convert a percentage to decimal. ; To convert a fraction to percentage, multiply the fraction by 100 and express the fraction in its simplest form. Do the opposite to convert a percentage to fraction ;"
